          The Butte Lab made the Covid Counties project open source so that the entire scientific community can benefit from and contribute to it. Our code is kept up to date on 
              <a href="https://github.com/vivical/ButteLabCOVID">Github</a>
              and also 
              <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pupster90/covid_tracker">Dockerhub.</a>
              Both sites provide in-depth tutorials on how to get started. The tutorial covers how to code Covid Counties on any device or operating system.  We hope this code helps other programmers with their work. We also look forward to future contributions being made to Covid Counties not by ourselves, but by the scientific community. If you have additions to the site or would like to collaborate do not hesitate to
